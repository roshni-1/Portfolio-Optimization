#### Portfolio optimization is a financial modeling technique used to construct an investment portfolio that aims to achieve the highest expected return for a given level of risk, or conversely, the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. . 
The optimization process involves using mathematical techniques to find the set of portfolio weights (allocation to each asset) that meets the defined objectives and constraints. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), developed by Harry Markowitz, is a foundational framework for portfolio optimization. MPT emphasizes the importance of diversification to achieve the optimal balance between risk and return.
